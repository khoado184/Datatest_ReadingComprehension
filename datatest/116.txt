Police Officer Tidwell left the station just after 8 a.m. on Sunday, June 4. He had spent an uneventful night on duty and was looking forward to his day of rest. By habit he took a short cut down the path behind Digby Hall Road and after a minute or two he saw a man climbing down a drain-pipe from an open bedroom window of number 29. In silence Tidwell crept into the garden. The man reached the ground and was dusting himself down when he felt his arm gripped.
"It’s 8.15 on a Sunday morning," said the officer, "and this sort of thing seems an unlikely adventure at such a time. Would you mind explaining?"
The man was obviously startled but kept calm. He said, "I know what you’re thinking, officer, but it isn’t true. This is a very funny mistake"
"It’s part of my job to take an interest in unusual events. I think you’ve just left this house in a manner other than the customary one. That may be quite innocent, but I’d like to make sure." Tidwell took out his notebook and a pen. "Name, address and occupation and then, please, tell me your story."
"Charlie Crane, lorry driver, from Nottingham, 51 Brecon street. My story…"
"Yes. What were you doing like a fly on that wall, Mr. Crane?"
"Well, I had a breakdown yesterday and had to stay the night here. Bed and breakfast. The landlady’s name is Mrs. Fern. She gave me breakfast at seven, and I was out of here in the right way and down at the lorry park by half past. It was only when I felt around for a cigarette I realized I’d left £80 in my pay envelope under the pillow here at number 29. I always put it under my pillow at night. It’s a habit I’ve got into. I even do it at home…"
"I see. Why didn’t you miss it when you went to pay Mrs. What’s-her-name?"
"I’d paid her last night. You’ve got to pay when you take the room, see? So I came rushing back, but it’s Sunday, and she’d gone back to bed, and could I wake her? I rang the bell and banged on the front door for ten minutes before I came round here to the back and spotted my bedroom window still open. Up I went, then, up this pipe. It’s a trick I learnt in the army. She hadn’t made the bed, and the money was still there. You know the rust, and I hope you believe it because …"
"Mr. Crane, whatever are you doing here? I thought you’d gone an hour ago." It was Mrs. Fern, speaking from the kitchen window at the corner of the house.
