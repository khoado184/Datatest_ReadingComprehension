The UK is playing its part in working towards a cleaner and greener planet. For the first time since the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, more of the UK’s energy is from zero-carbon fuels than fossil fuels. In each of the first five months of 2019, fossil fuels produced less than half of the UK’s electricity. This means that the trend of using more zero-carbon energy sources than fossil fuels will go on. Power from wind, solar, nuclear, and hydro sources will outstrip coal and gas. A decade ago, three- quarters of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels.

The UK’s energy chief executive said the use of more renewable energy was a “key milestone on the journey towards net zero carbon emissions”. He said the zero-carbon share should increase to 90 percent by the 2030s. The UK’s Prime Minister said the UK would reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The UK would be the first major economy to do this. An energy analyst told the BBC that the milestone was a tribute to technologists who solved the technical problems of climate change. He said “net zero” means fewer jobs in fossil fuel industries and more in low-carbon industries.
