Like all growing plants, the potato is a product of the seamless cooperation of sun, soil, temperature and water. However, while potatoes thrive on moisture, so, too, does the potato’s worst affliction,- late blight. After attacking and blackening the leaves, phytophthora infestans spores move down the stem, eventually reaching and rotting the tubers in the ground. Even those potatoes harvested and stored may carry the fungus and be wiped out.

The search for the cause of the blight that ruined the Irish plants in the 1840’s and the Polish plants in 1980 preoccupied researchers for years. M.J.Berkeley, a 19th-century naturalist, first recognized that the fungus appearing on the potato plants in 1845 in Ireland and elsewhere was not the result of the blight but the cause. Working in Germany, another scientist, Henrich Anton de Bary, proved Berkeley’s theory by identifying the fungus as an outgrowth on the host. It took another hundred years, however, before the mystery of the origin of the fungus was solved, and the pathogen itself was traced to central Mexico.

Late blight has traditionally been held in check with costly chemical fungicides. Unfortunately, for many farmers, the chemicals are too expensive, if available at all. Therefore today, identifying or creating blight-resistant potato species is the major goal of agricultural researchers interested in late blight.
