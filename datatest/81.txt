Dear Mr. Morris,
In our meeting last week with you, you expressed an interest in reserving our largest banquet hall for your annual meeting on September 20. At the time, I made a tentative reservation and sent a contract to you. I requested that the contract be signed and returned to my attention within ten business days. As of this morning, I have not yet received the executed contract. 
I need to know if you still intend to make use of our facilities as soon as possible. If not, we have another company that is interested in the same banquet hall and is prepared to make a deposit. If I do not hear from you within the next 48 hours. I’m going to assume that you’re no longer interested and will cancel the reservation. If you want to keep the reservation, please contact me as soon as possible. Should you no longer have the original contract, I would be more than happy to send you another copy. I look forward to your response.

John Bates
Front Desk Manager
