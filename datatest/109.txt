We had just got past the Customs Officer, Bijou and I, and I was relieved the country’s laws on importing animals were so loose. By the looks of surprise I had received from fellow passengers, I had feared they might be strict. The most amusing thing was that everyone officially concerned, at the airports and in the air, had referred to Bijou as “a live dog”; for I could not imagine a dog other than a live one travelling anywhere. But regulations are meant to be obeyed, so “live” he was.
I had been given a box for him to travel in if he needed it, called a “Courtesy Kennel”; and it was this box that had brought the steely light of suspicion to the eyes of the Customs Officer when I had stood before him. He had thought, as his question made clear, that I was trying to bring in a colour TV set or something similar, subject to a high rate of duty. When he found the box contained only a dog – “Ah, a live dog!” he exclaimed with some disappointment – he waved me away with the rest of the passengers going through unchecked.
Outside the Arrival Hall we joined the queue for a taxi. Being a party of only one, human at any rate, I was not too popular with the drivers, who probably made more out of groups, unless it was Bijou they did not like; and we had to wait until everyone else had departed. At last I was courted for my trade, and I selected from the queue now facing me a large blue car, whose driver offered to take me to a “hotel comfortable”, and Bijou and I got in. We had driven less than a hundred metres when a policeman on a motor-cycle stopped US. The driver and he began a furious argument through the taxi window. Now if there is anything that annoys Bijou, it is the sound of human voices raised in anger; and he tries to drown the voices with barking. He did that now. The policeman ordered US out.
The driver turned to me. “The dog must get out, sir,” he said. “In our country it’s illegal to carry them in taxis. Never mind, we’ll put him in the back with your cases. I’m sorry about this, but we’ll soon…”
So Bijou, with much loss of dignity, was banished to the back. The policeman, red in the face, drove off. So did we, but only until the motor-cyclist was out of sight. Then we stopped again, and Bijou rejoined me. Soon we reached the hotel.
