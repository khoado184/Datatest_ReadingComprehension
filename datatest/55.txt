We recently discovered that your subscription to Gourmet Chef Monthly will expire in September and you have not decided to renew it. To encourage you to reconsider your decision, we'd like to offer you a special, one-time-only offer: if you choose to renew your subscription, we will give you a fifty percent discount on each monthly issue from October to March. According to our database, you were paying $6.00 per issue; with this discount you would only have to pay $3.00. This offer is only valid if you apply to renew your subscription before September 15th. We're offering to cut the cost of your subscription in half. Can you really ask for a better deal?
To accept our offer, please call us at 1-8oo-254-9864. Our office is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Don't miss out on this wonderful opportunity; call one of our helpful customer service agents today. We look forward to your business.
Warmest Regards, 
Ross Cather
Sales Director, Gourmet Chef Monthly
