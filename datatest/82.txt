TO: AGP8X Employees
FROM: Sylvie Hamm, Director, Human Relations
Dear Colleagues,
AGP8X Corporation recognizes the importance of having a first-rate employee exercise facility on the premises. For the past three years, we have worked very hard to improve the employee exercise facility. We purchased new exercise equipment, renovated locker rooms and began offering a new safety training course.
A month ago, you responded enthusiastically to the survey about the fitness center. Based on your recommendations, new changes will be planned. They will take effect on January 2. Finally, the employee fitness center will be open on extra three hours Monday through Thursday. Also, long-time members will be surely pleased to hear that the popular personal manager Tony Stumpo will be promoted to the manager of the fitness center.
We encourage more employees to take advantage of what the center has to offer. Memberships will continue to be subsidized and remain at $20 per month. And for a limited time only, we offer a special rate for new members. Members who sign up before December 31 will be charged only $15 per month for their first year. Contact Tony Stumpo to sign up at this reduced rate.
