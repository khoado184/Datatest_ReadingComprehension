There is a wide range of organisms by their population whose lives mostly depend on how they hunt or are hunted. And most living organisms have some way of protecting themselves from natural predators. Some mammals, like the platypus, carry internal toxins to transmit to predators via biting or other means, and some plants protect themselves by being poisonous. The African crested rat was originally thought to be poisonous because predators that tried to eat it often became paralyzed. But scientists have recently learned that’s not actually the case.

The crested rat chews on the poisonous bark of a certain tree, and then smears the chewed-up substance onto its fur, where a strip of special quill-like hairs soaks up the poisonous mixture. Though similar to a porcupine’s, the quills do differ: whereas the porcupine defends itself by poking predators, the African rat uses its quill-like hairs to deliver poison to them. When a predator comes after it, instead of running away, the rat stays put and parts its hair to reveal the strip of fur on its back where the poison is being stored. That raised strip is the first thing that receives a bite, and the poison inside disables the predator. These hair tubes are unusual. In fact, scientists do not know of another animal that uses plant poison in this way.

Scientists are puzzled that the rat doesn’t appear to be affected by the poison. Because it affects heartbeat regulation, understanding how the rat can keep its heart rate regulated effectively while using the poison could help scientists develop new medicines for people with heart trouble. And they hope that those suffering from heart diseases will benefit from this.
