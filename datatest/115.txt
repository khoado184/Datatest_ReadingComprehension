When Brooke married his Irish nurse, the colonel gave him two weeks to go with her to her country, so that he could meet her people and see what the place was like. Southern Ireland, though only across a narrow sea, was not at war. That seemed to make it an inviting place, a strange place, more foreign than France or Egypt.
“You take ship from Holyhead,” said the colonel. Til give you a ticket and a pass to say you’re an Irishman on leave. But remember, you’re not to wear uniform unless you want to spend the rest of the war in an Irish prison. Get a suit and a shirt from somebody and leave your army stuff here. In uniform they’ll pick you up as soon as you step off the boat.”
Brooke arranged the journey without too much trouble. An army man could do practically what he wanted in those days, especially a lame man with a couple of ribbons on his chest. Brooke had fought through the North African war, and then the invasion of Europe. He had got his leg wound in France and been nursed back to near normal health by Bernie Hale, now Mrs. Brooke.
It’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good. The bombing was severe, and Bernie’s hospital, crowded and busy with wounded, was so badly damaged on the day before she got married that there was nowhere immediately for her to work. Her patients were sent elsewhere, and that allowed her to take her holidays.
The boat to Dublin was crowded. All the passengers wore civilian clothes, and all seemed to have a great air of cheerfulness and pride, too, Brooke thought. The atmosphere was of a victorious return from a meeting with some challenge. They were nearly all young people. They talked and laughed about the war. Brooke guessed they were Irish men and women who did not share their country’s determination to keep out of the war. They did not want to miss the chance of a good fight.
Dublin seemed a fairy city that evening. There were lights everywhere, in complete contrast to blacked-out Europe. The people were pink-cheeked, cheerful, not pale and war-weary. Bombs and rockets did not disturb the sleep of the Irish. The manageress of the hotel Brooke and Bernie stayed at refused to believe they were married, it was separate rooms or nothing.
Next morning, when Brooke asked the hotel porter to help with one of the heavy cases, the man said, “No, I’ve got other things to do. Don’t you people know there’s a war on?” That angered Bernie, but Brooke could only laugh.
