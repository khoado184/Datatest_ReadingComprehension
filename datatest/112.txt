Katy had fallen asleep after lunch in one of Mrs. Hamley’s comfortable armchairs. An open magazine lay on her knee and one arm hung down loosely. She looked soft and young, like a child; and a rush of love sprang into her father’s heart.

“Katy,” he said gently, taking hold of the hand that was hanging down. She opened her eyes, though for a moment there was no recognition in them. Then the light flashed into them, and she sprang up, throwing her arms around his neck. “Fancy coming while I was asleep. I’ve missed the pleasure of watching for you.”

He turned a little paler, but he still held her hand and took her to sit on the wide window seat. As she kept on talking, there was no need for him to speak.

“I was up so early this morning. It was lovely being out in the garden. Isn’t it a gloriously hot day? I wonder if the Italian skies they talk about can be bluer than that- there, just between those trees.”

She pulled her hand away and used it and the other to turn his head, so that he should see exactly the bit she meant. She noticed his unusual silence.

“Do you know, Dad,” she said, “I don’t think you look very well. You want me at home to take care of you. When can I come?”

“It must be your fancy, Katy. I feel full of beans; and I ought to be too. I’ve a piece of news for you.” He felt he was making a mess of this business, but he was determined to get it over. “Can you guess it?”

“How should I?” she said; but her voice sounded less firm, as if she was trying to prepare herself for something unwelcome.

“Well, you see,” he went on, “you’re in a slightly awkward position, growing up as you are alone with me. I have to be away on these business trips so much.”

“But there’s Mrs. Wilson, “Katy said, feeling sick now with the strengthening knowledge of what was coming. “I want nothing but her and you.”

“Still, there are times when Mrs. Wilson can’t be with you. She doesn’t live with us, and she has other responsibilities. I’ve been worried for some time, but at last I’ve taken a step which will, I hope, make US both happier.”

“Now I know what you’re trying to say, Dad. I see it all now. I was sent here, to be out of the house, so that it could be quietly arranged in my absence. You re going to – I’m going to- “There were words she could not say, thoughts she hated to think. The solid ground she had stood on seemed to break from the shore and carry her out to sea alone. Then she asked: “Do you want me to call her mother?”
