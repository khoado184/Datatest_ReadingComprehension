‘Oh, you’re so lucky living in Bath, it’s such a wonderful, lovely, historic place,’ people say enthusiastically, and all you can think of is the awful parking, the crowds of tourists, the expensive shops, the narrow-minded council, and the terrible traffic…

Luckily I don’t live in Bath but nearly ten miles away in a village called Limpley stoke in the Avon Valley. It seems to be normal in the countryside these days for professional people who work in the town to prefer to live in the villages; this makes the housing so expensive that the villagers and agricultural workers have to live in the cheaper accommodation in town, with the result that the farmers commute out to the farm and everyone else commutes in. Certainly, there’s nobody in the village who could be called an old-style villager. The people nearest to me include a pilot, an accountant, a British Rail manager, a retired teacher … not a farm worker amongst them. But I don’t think there is anything wrong with that – it’s just that the nature of villages is changing and there is still quite a strong sense of community here. A lot of this sense of community comes from the Post Office, which is a centre for all the gossip and information. I find out what is going on while I am there, pretending to control my two-year-old son. He enjoys anything he can touch at the lowest level of the shop, which consists mainly of an enormous rack of cards saying ‘Congratulations on your 9th Birthday’ and a collecting tin for the ‘Save The Children’ charity, which he always picks up and tries to run away with. My feeling is that if my son took the money collected for the children, it would go directly where it was needed but they don’t see it like that.

Working at home, I tend to wander round the village at times when other people are at the office, which has given me a reputation for being incredibly lazy or unbelievably rich, but I still don’t get enough time to look after the garden we bought. My wife had a good idea for the first year. ‘Let’s just leave it and see what comes up.’ There were some nice plants among the weeds. She had a good idea for the second year as well. ‘Why don’t we leave it and see if it all comes up again?’ We did, and that is why we need to hire a full-time gardener this year.
