THE FAMOUS ROCKETTES
Imagine a long line of dancers performing a difficult high kick at exactly the same time. That was the vision of Russell Markert, who came up with the idea for the Rockettes back in 1925. The Rockettes, an allfemale dance group, have come a long way with their high kicks. They have performed at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City since its opening in 1932.
The goal of the Rockettes is for all of the dancers to make the same movements at the exact same time, as if they were one person rather than 36. This task requires a lot of practice, skill, and cooperation. The Rockettes perform in more than 200 shows over a two-month period. The schedule requires a huge commitment from the dancers.
Over the years, more than 3,000 women have danced as Rockettes. They say that performing with the group is a dream come true, despite the long hours of practice and the demanding schedule. They love it when the audience stands and cheers.
