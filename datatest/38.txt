Subject: Employee Lunch
Hello everyone,
I just wanted to remind you all that the annual employee luncheon will be held this Friday, March l6th. It will be held at 1 p.m. at the Emerald Counuy Club. Lunch will be provided, but we would like each associate to bring one dessert. There is a sign-up sheet in the break room next to the water cooler. Also, this year we will be celebrating the achievements of Bob Hopey, the Director of Advertising, who will be retiring at the end of March. Mr. Hopey has worked for Best Advertising for thirty years, and was responsible for the successful merger with McKinley Advertising in 2004. He will be missed greatly, and we are asking each associate to contribute $25 for a goodbye gift. The gift will be handed to him at the luncheon. Please give the money to Barbara Whales in Human Resources by Thursday, March 15th.
Thanks, Helen Mariin
