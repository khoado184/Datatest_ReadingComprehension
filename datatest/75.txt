Dear Sirs,
Four months ago, I signed up for a premium membership at Fitness First at a monthly fee of $55. When I signed up, I was told that I was free to cancel my membership at any time, for any reason, with no extra payment. 
Since I joined, I have been extremely disappointed in the Fitness First's facilities and staff. The locker rooms and swimming pools are poorly maintained and extremely dirty. The Jacuzzi has been out of order for more than a month and repairs on it have not even begun. The Pilates class schedule has been changed several times, without notice, and the instructor never seemed to be fully devoted to the class.
I telephoned Fitness First and was told that - contrary to what I was told verbally when signing up - I would have to pay a "processing fee" of $75 to end my membership. One week later, I received a bill in the mail saying I still owed the processing fee. I refuse to pay this fee.
 If you continue billing me, I will be discussing the matter with my lawyer. In addition, I will be filing formal complaints with the City Business Bureau and the Health Department about the unsanitary condition of your facilities.
I suggest you discuss the matter with your billing department immediately.
