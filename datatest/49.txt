Hi Lindsey,

To honor both your work as Senior Sales Supervisor and Mr.Hulking's recent achievement, I would like to ask you to present the award this Saturday. As part of the presentation ceremony, you will be asked to give a brief speech about Mr.Hulking. It would be a good idea to indude some personal anecdotes as well as professional stories to help highlight Mr.Hulking's character.
