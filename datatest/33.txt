Dear Andy,
Hello from Hawaii!
This place is beautiful! I'm staying at a small hotel on the beach. It took about four hours to get here from the airport. I took a taxi after I got off the airplane, then a bus, and then I had a short boat ride. When I finally arrived, I was really tired. But, i'm glad I came. Wish you were here. See you next week.
Janet
