At sixteen Ron Mackie might have stayed at school, but the future called to him excitedly. “Get out of the classroom into a job,” it said, and Ron obeyed. His father, supporting the decision, found a place for him in a supermarket. “You’re lucky, Ron,” he said. “For every boy with a job these days, there’s a dozen without.” So Ron joined the working world at twenty pounds a week.
For a year he spent his days filling shelves with tins of food. By the end of that time he was looking back on his schooldays as a time of great variety and satisfaction. He searched for an interest in his work, with little success. However, Fridays came around unfailingly and with them Ron’s pay; but the best thing about the place was Judy on the cash desk. Ron got on well with all the girls when the manager was not around. They liked him too, though he did not see that.
One fine day instead of going to work Ron got a lift on a lorry going south. With nine pounds in his pocket, a full heart and a great longing for the sea, he set out to make a better way for himself. That evening, in Bournemouth, he had a sandwich and a drink in a cafe run by an elderly man and his wife. Before he had finished the sandwich, the woman had taken him on for the rest of the summer, at twenty pounds a week, a room upstairs and three meals a day. The ease and speed of it rather took Ron’s breath away. At quiet times Ron had to check the old man’s arithmetic in the records of the business.
At the end of the season he stayed on the coast. He was again surprised how straightforward it was for a boy of seventeen to make a living. He worked in shops mostly, but once he took a job in a hotel for three weeks. Late in October, he was taken on by the sick manager of a shoe shop, where a woman and two girls also worked. Ron soon found himself in charge there; he was the only one who could keep the books. He and the girls shared a flat above the shop. By this time he knew there was something about him that women of all ages liked. He was not sure what it was, except that he felt warm and playful and sensitive towards them.
