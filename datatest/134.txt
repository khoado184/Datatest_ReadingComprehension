Botanists and biomedical scientists have been collecting evidence for decades that tannins, compounds of plant origin that are found in tea and red wine, can cause cancer of the esophagus, which is almost always fatal. In 1962, they began to investigate a fivefold increase in the rate of cancer of the esophagus among the Bantu of Africa from 1943 to 1953

Soon after, they began to search for causes of the disease among the inhabitants of Curacao and other Caribbean islands. Interviews with victims and surviving relatives led them to suspect that something in the diet was causing the cancer. Three of the dietary plants that they had collected produced tumours in 100 percent of their experimental animals. The suspect plants were all native teas with medicinal application. Though the plants were not related botanically, the one thing they had in common was condensed tannin.

Tannins, like caffeine and nicotine, serve plants as defenses against insects and other predators. Tannins were found in the sorghum that serves both the Bantu and the people of Curacao as a dietary staple. The botanists theorized that a drought had been indirectly responsible for the cancer epidemic among the Bantu, because it forced them to rely more on tannin-rich sorghum, which is extremely drought resistant, after their other staple crops died out.

While studies have shown that tannins produce liver cancer in lab animals, human studies involving tannins so far have been only field observations, under controlled conditions. Some scientists believe other factors, such as smoking and drinking ethanol (beverage alcohol) also contribute to esophageal cancer in humans.
