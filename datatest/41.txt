The Health Factory will introduce a new line of vitamins, a company spokesman said yesterday. The vitamins are intended for athletic men and women, who are looking for a vitamin that will replace vital nutrients lost during strenuous exercise. Unlike regular vitamins, the Health Factory Active Essentials 2020 have more iron, calcium, and potassium. The new vitamins have been tested on professional athletes, such as cyclist Luke Wilson, and are proven to increase athletic performance by up to 20 percent. Of course, health products like the Active Essentials vitamins are not cheap. One month's supply of the new vitamins costs about $200. To promote the new product, however, the Health Factory is offering a special 30 percent discount to anyone who purchases the new vitamins with their Health Factory card. For more information on the new product or to apply for a Health Factory card, call the company's customer service hotline at 1-800-326-HEALTH.
