LETTER TO THE NEWPORT EVENING NEWS
On Saturday afternoon I left my handbag on the bus. In it were my cheque book, address book and my purse, which contained about $ 50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late, I didn’t know what to do: I’m 72 years old, I was a long way from home, and I was quite worried. In fact, I stood by the side of the road and just cried. A young man asked me what was wrong and I explained what had happened to me. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened he said I should keep the fare.

I got home safely and the telephone rang soon after. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus on which I had left my handbag. He said that they had my handbag and he offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, amazingly with all its contents untouched. I would just like to say how wonderful everybody was who helped me on that day, and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

Mrs. B. James, Newport.
