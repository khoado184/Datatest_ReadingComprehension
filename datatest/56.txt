This month, Rockford Sports has experienced an unexpected increase in the sale of running shoes. Executives feel that this was due in large part to the new ad campaign released in February. The campaign was orchestrated by Albert Sterling, the Director of Advertising. Mr.Sterling has dedicated twenty years of his life to Rockford Sports; he started as a shoes salesman and has been steadily working his way up the corporate ladder ever since. He has held his current position for the last five years. Unfortunately, Mr.Sterling will be retiring in Narch so the Hiring Committee has spent the past year trying to find a suitable replacement. just last week, a candidate was chosen for the position: Roy Portsmouth. For the past ten years, Mr.Portsmouth has been the Executive Advertising Assistant at Famous Feet's corporate headquarters in Milan. Mr.Portsmouth is respected for his keen marketing sense and strategic planning skills. In particular, he is famous for introducing ad campaigns that helped increase Famous Feet's international brand power, and boosted its total retail profits by 25 percent. Clearly, Mr.Portsmouth will be a powerful addition to our company, and we hope all employees make him feel welcome.
