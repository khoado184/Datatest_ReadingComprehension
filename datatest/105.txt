DESERT LIFE
Living in the desert usually means extreme heat and dry, arid conditions. There are different types of deserts. Some deserts have more plant life than other deserts. The largest desert in the world is the Sahara Desert. This desert covers over a million square miles of land.
Like all deserts, the Sahara has very little vegetation. However, there are some plants that have learned to grow without very much rain. Cacti are examples of plants that can live for almost a year without rain. When a cactus does receive rain, it produces beautiful and striking flowers.
Many of the animals that live in the desert are the same color as the environment. These sand-colored animals often burrow into the sand to avoid the extreme heat. Many of these animals are nocturnal animals, which means they feed and are active mostly during the night. When there is a severe drought, many of these animals sleep to save water and their need for food.
Camels are another type of animal commonly found in the Sahara Desert. The camel is able to go for a week without any drinking water. The camel’s hump serves as food storage. A camel will drink up to 16 gallons of water at one time.
