Africa’s legendary pygmy elephant may be the largest unrecognized animal in the world. In the past couple of years two German zoologists have built a strong case for the existence of the six-foot-tall elephant as a separate species.

Zoologists currently accept the existence of only one species of African elephant. This species, Loxodonta africana , consists of two subspecies, the 11- foot savannah elephant of southern and eastern Africa and the smaller eight-foot forest elephant found in central and western Africa. The pygmy elephant, on the other hand, has been dismissed as nothing more than a Loxodonta juvenile.

However, a paper published in the German Journal of the Cologne Zoo details a number of significant skull characteristics that distinguish this controversial creature from others. Moreover, pygmy elephants are said to be much more aggressive than the generally playful Loxodonta juveniles.

If pygmy elephants are juveniles, argue the German zoologists, how then can you explain their fully grown tusks, the puberty of small female, and the presence of entire pygmy herds? In fact, a set of colour slides taken by a former German ambassador to the Congo depicts pygmy elephants together with their own juveniles, as well as some other animals, providing an objective scale. Yet zoologists remain skeptical.

“I’m convinced that there are small elephants running around the forest,” says one elephant expert,” but I’m not certain yet what the explanation is. What we need are some tissue or blood samples for biochemical analysis.”
