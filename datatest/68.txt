The Grant Corporation plans to open a new factory by the end of 2008, a company spokesman said. The new factory is scheduled to be built in Dobson County and will create approximately 1,000 new jobs for the local community. The mayor of Dobson County, Frank Ploy, said the new factory will be a positive addition to the town, and that the town will support all efforts to construct the factory as planned. The Grant Corporation is the world's largest producer of airplane parts, and is renowned for its strict environmental policies. In 2007, the company received the prestigious Better Business Award for implementing a new waste management program that decreased the amount of industrial waste it produced by nearly 25 percent. Currently, the company owns four other factories, and has been very successful at securing the support of all the communities it affects. Just last March, the factory in Trenton, New Jersey, sponsored a charity event that raised 2 million dollars for a local elementary school. The residents of Dobson County hope to receive the same benefits from the new factory. The Grant Corporation plans to build the new facility on the grounds of the old Milner Factory, Milner Automobiles abandoned the factory last year after it built a bigger factory in Michelan, a city about thirty five miles north of Dobson County. According to a company spokesman, the old factory will be demolished before construction on the new facility begins.
