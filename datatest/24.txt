Dear jane,
How are you? I'm at my aunt and uncle's house in the country. I'm having a great time. The country air is so clean. I ride horses every day with my uncle. He is giving me lots of advice. my aunt cooks delicious food for every meal. She taught me how to make chocolate chip cookies. I would like to stay for another week, but I can't. My vacation will be over. I will see you in two days, and I will tell you all about it.
Your friend,
