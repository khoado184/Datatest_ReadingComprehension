Dear Mr.Benson,
I have written to you several times over the past two months requesting an explannation on why you have failed to bring your account with us up-to-date.
By ignoring these requests, you are damaging the excellent credit record you had previously maintained with our company. In addition, every month that you fail to pay your account, you receive a $25 late payment fee. As of the date of this letter, your account balance is $235.04.
Unless I hear from you within ten days. I will have no other choice but to turn your account over to a debt collection agency. I am sorry that we must take such drastic action but I am afraid you leave us no choice. You can preserve your credit rating by sending us a check for the amount stated above.
Sincerely,
Ross Gunter
Director of Accounting

Dear Mr.Benson
Thank you for your letter. You deserve an explannation for what went wrong in our accounting department, and I hope that this letter will help resolve our recent error. It has taken a lot of time to find out what happened, so please accept our apologies for the delay in this response.
A thorough look at our records revealed that we did receive your April payment on time, as you stated in your letter of June 25. However, it was credited to an account which bears a similar name to yours. Therefore, we began sending you our standard notices requesting payment, in keeping with our routine policy.
I am sorry for all the distress we have caused you. You have been a valued customer of ours for a long time and we appreciate your understanding. To express our sincerest apologies, we would like to send you a $175 gift certificate to the wilson spa and massage center.
sincerely,
Ross Gutter
Director of Accounting,
Advanced Financial
