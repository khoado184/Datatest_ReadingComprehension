It is not difficult for me to guess why I developed a love of cats in my life. Cats will let us love them, in fact they plainly wish US to, but they will not love US in return, though many of US persuade ourselves that they do. On the other hand, they do not pretend to return our feelings, nor do they make promises that they cannot or will not keep.

I never saw my cat Tim hurry; nobody did, even when he catching mice, though long before he died he had given up trying to do so. It was not that he was a lazy cat; I think he had come to the conclusion that the mice had just as much right to live as he had, and since they were not his enemies and he would have disliked eating one, he could see no point in stretching out a soft paw to bring it down on a struggling back.

He was proud but gentle; I remember as a child putting my finger to his mouth to feel his warm breath, and despite the fact that he normally avoided showing affection , he licked my finger slowly, so that I felt for the first time that curious roughness that all cats’ tongues have.

He would never play in the ordinary sense, a ball on the end of a string he ignored, and though he would occasionally go after one rolled across the floor he would not, having caught it, repeat the action as soon as he realized it was only a game. Nor would he never beg; it was beneath his dignity, and besides, his wants were few.

Tim was the only cat I have ever known who understood what a mirror was. In my grandfather’s shop there was a full-length mirror, too big and heavy to hang or even fix, so it stood against the wall with its base a few inches out. All other cats I have ever seen before a mirror were confused; they either failed to see their reflection or, seeing it, would think it was another cat, and, after putting out an exploratory paw, would run around behind the mirror, into the space made by the angle at which it leaned against the wall. Tim was plainly aware that it was his own self that he saw in it – but he did not need the mirror to tell him he was handsome; it is generally only the man or woman who lacks confidence who needs constantly to look in the mirror, and doubtless the same applies to cats.
