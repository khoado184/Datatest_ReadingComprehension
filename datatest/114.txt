We knew Sylvia and Jack had had problems with their flat, but we had not been told the details. Not until they came for a weekend in September, that is.
At dinner on the Friday evening Kitty said, “You wrote that the flat wasn’t quite what you expected. We imagined the worst, like horrid neighbours or rising damp. Of course, it could be just too small. You’re sharing with another couple, aren’t you?”
“Were sharing, Mother,” Sylvia replied.
“It really wasn’t necessary,” Jack explained proudly. “I’ve had a substantial rise, and we can easily manage. It’s much better to be independent”
“Oh, much,” I agreed.
“What was the trouble?” Kitty asked, impatient and unwilling to let go.
“Nothing much,” Sylvia said. “The flat’s fine. It was the other couple, Sally and Tom Ford. You’ve never seen such an untidy pair. We shared the sitting-room and the kitchen and the bathroom and got fed up with the mess of it all.”
“And what made it worse,” Jack put in, “was that they accused US of the same sort of thing. Tom and I nearly came to blows when he locked up some of their wedding presents we were all using, as they used ours, naturally.”
“You take a chance when you make a sharing arrangement,” Kitty said, “unless you’ve known the other people a long time. Were they always disorganised like that, or did it start suddenly? Something might have upset the girl”
“I knew her for three years at college, Mother. She seemed all right then. I had the shock of my life when I saw how she and Tom lived.”
“I never realised you were so particular, my dear,” Kitty said with a smile.
“I am, in my own flat,” Sylvia said. “Sally and Tom left a month ago.”
“We could have left instead,” Jack said. “But why should we? After all, the flat was in our names, not theirs. We were glad to see the back of them.”
Two weeks later Kitty and I returned their visit for lunch on Sunday. It was the first time we had been to their flat. To say that we were shocked is not true, because we knew our daughter extremely well. The flat had fairly recently been in quite good condition; it was now a chaos of dirt and damage and indescribable confusion. I did not know how anyone could possibly live there. But Sylvia noticed nothing.”
