Dear Mr. Paycheck,
We appreciate your request a few days ago to increase your credit limit on your Visa Card from $7,500 to $10,000. National Bank has carefully reviewed your overall credit rating, your current bank balances, and your payment history for the debts you carry on your Visa Card, we are afraid to tell you that we are not able to accept your request at this time. However, we could review your case again after the 1st of January, taking into account your further payment history and any new credit information you may wish to provide. Please submit another written request if you wish us to do so. 
Mr. Paycheck, you are a valued customer to us. If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call by telephone. We are always willing to do the best we can for you.
Sincerely,
Jason Notts

Dear Mr. Notts,
Thank you for your kindness for at least considering to raise my credit card limit, although unfortunately you were not able to accept my request. Yes, I do admit that my credit card payments have not been consistent and are sometimes late. But I really need the expansion of my credit card limit, therefore I do wish that you will consider my case again on the 1st of January. And I hope that by then my credit rating will be better so that you will accept my request.
Sincerely, 
Bill
