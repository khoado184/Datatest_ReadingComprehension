Dear Mr. Foster:
I went to the bank today and paid the bill, but I remitted an amount bigger than the bill. The bill was 89.95, but I sent you 899.50. May I please have the remainder of the money I have sent returned to my bank account? Or may I use the money to pay my bills for the rest of the year? I had to pay 4 bills that were overdue today, so I figured I’d pay this bill also and was in a rush and made this one digit mistake. Please call me back at 555-8821 for assistance on this matter. If there is no call, I will stop by myself to see what’s happening. Thank you.
