Anna liked the look of the house as soon as she saw it. Jack knew that before she said anything. The plain white walls, the black window frames and door – the good taste of that combination had always pleased her.

“It’s a nice family house,” she said. “One can see it’s been well lived in.”

Fifty-seven Eden Square was a tall narrow house on three floors in the middle of a row facing a small park. It was in what a house agent would call a popular rather than a fashionable area. The little front gate was open, broken They went in and up a few stone steps to the front door. They could see in through one of the sitting-room windows from which a net curtain had fallen at one side. The large room was almost bare. A dirty green carpet half covered the floor. From an old brick fire-place a gas-fire had been pulled out into the room. The wall-paper was dark green, dirty and damp-looking. There was no furniture. Silently they stared in. Then Jack tried the front door. It was locked.

“It’s been empty a long while,” he said. “All last winter at least. Is it worth going to the agent to get the keys? We’d have to do an awful lot of cleaning up.”

“Any empty house up for sale needs cleaning,” said Anna. “That’s part of the fun of buying. You can make it look so different. This place will be a lot better when I’ve had a go at it. How much do you think it’ll cost?”

“Well, it’s about eighty years old, and modernized probably.” He stepped back and looked up. “It should have three or four large bedrooms, as large as I think bedrooms ought to be, and one or two small ones. That is, if it wasn’t used as a guest house in the days before people started going to Spain for their holidays. I think it would cost about fifteen thousand. It depends on how modern it is inside. We’ll get the keys and have a look, shall we?”

They did so the following afternoon. In an earlier, more spacious time, the house had had large, airy bedrooms. All four of these were now divided up by wooden walls and ugly passages. Each big window looking on to the park was shared by two or even three rooms. There were in all eighteen tiny bedrooms, each with a tiny wash-basin and water: sleeping spaces for thirty or so holidaymakers.

“Little cages,” Anna said. She did not like the place at all.
