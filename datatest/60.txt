Dear Ms.Hunt,
I am pleased to inform you that the eighth annual Computer Innovation Conference will take place from July 22-23 at the Henderson Hotel in Park County, Colorado. This year, we expect to receive as many participants as in previous years: over 3,000 computer specialists from all over the world, including some of the most highly respected individuals in the field. As always, it is our sincerest hope that Watson and Rye Media will participate in the Publisher's Showcase for displaying your latest electronic publishing products, including journals, software, and any other relevant materials.
The exquisite Boulder Room, which will be set up with tables, shelves, electronic equipment and Internet access, will be available for you to display multi-media products. The adjoining Silver Springs Room will be reserved for showcasing printed media, like books and magazines.
If you would like to reserve a space to set up a display, please fill out the registration form enclosed with this letter. Please remember to indicate which room you would like to reserve, and the times that you would like to reserve it for. Also, I should inform you that, due to problems we had last year, all fees must be paid at the time of registration. You should submit everything by June l5th. lf you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 514- 698-9874, or email me at torson@conference.hmg.com.
Sincerely,
Thomas Oison

Subjem: Exhibits for HMG Conference
Dear Mr.Orson,
I was very excited to receive your invitation to attend the HMG Computer Innovation Conference. Before I submit the application and fee, however, I would like to ask you an important question about the rules for setting up an exhibit. Since our company handles both electronic and print media products, we would prefer to display our product lines together. Is there any possibility that we would be able to set up both of our exhibits in the Boulder Room.
Thank you so much for your time. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Lauren Hunt
