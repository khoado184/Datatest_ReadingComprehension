The contract was finally signed and we moved one Saturday in June. A carpenter cut the table, which had been originally constructed in a classroom, in two, and took the bookcase apart. We lowered chairs on the end of a rope down through a window into the street below and took down the bull-fighting poster – only to find that Raphael, who had decorated the wall, had been conscientious enough with our money not to paint underneath. As we carried crates of books down the sixty-seven steps, I remembered our struggles up the stairs two years earlier.
Soon the flat was empty, with even the carpet ripped up. We stood for a moment in the deserted waiting room and then clattered finally down the steps.
At our new address in Shaftesbury Avenue, regulations made things difficult for a lorry which was now loaded with chairs and tables. Our driver eventually parked in a side street and we pulled the furniture up past a large shop-window. Saturday afternoon crowds were in the streets and we had to be careful or chairs and tables would have gone crashing down on their heads. As we were working a young man I had never seen before, approached US and offered to help. He staggered up the stairs with armful of books, and helped me carry up the heavy red reception desk. When we had finished, I offered to pay him but he refused adamantly and vanished into the crowd again like some visiting angel.
Until we got used to it, it seemed incredible that, with our resources, we were now installed right in the centre of London. It made US feel like adventurers. In the evening w sat in the sitting room and there was no need to put on the lights. Opposite were the Apollo and Globe theatres; outside the- lights and noise of traffic. A man with a concertina was singing below US. There were shouts and then the sound of feet running down the street. In the middle of so much life, it was like being on an island, hidden yet seeing sheltered against the flood.
