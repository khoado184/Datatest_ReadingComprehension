Employment Officer	 
Porter Invesments
67 Waltham Ave.
Boston. MA
Dear Mr.Wright,
I was extremely interested in your recent advertisement for an Assistant Accountant, which appeared in the March issue of Financial Times. I am confident that my educational background and work experience make me the ideal candidate for this position.
I graduated last year with high honors from Georgetown University, where I double majored in accounting and economics. My thesis, â€˜the Economics of investing," received the highest grade in my class. While at University, I was also president of the Finance Club, and the Treasurer of the Student Council. In my junior year, I was responsible for organizing a fundraising event that collected 50 thousand dollars for the new gymnasium on campus.
Last summer, I was accepted for an internship position with Harvey Investments, a famous New York investment firm. During my two months at Hervey Investments, I managed over 20 corporate accounts, and was responsible for approximately 1 million dollars in investment.
I have enclosed a detailed resume, along with two letters of recommendation, and my University transcript. I hope you will find my personality and work experience a good match for this position. Please feel free to contact me at 896-326-5478, if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Richard Bolt
