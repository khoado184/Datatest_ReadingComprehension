Subject: Defective Printer
Dear Mrs.Willow,	
My company, Pip Imaging, purchased an Easy Jet 1435 printer from your company four weeks ago. Three weeks ago, an employee reported that the printer turned off every time she tried to print on both sides. A week after the problem was reported, a repairman came to the office to fix the problem. After spending an entire day taking apart the machine, he determined that the printer was missing an important screw. It is critical that we have a functioning printer in order to provide our customers with quality photocopies. Therefore, it is important that we fix this problem as soon as possible. We will be closing temporarily in two weeks from June 23rd to July 2nd, while we change locations, and we would like to resolve this problem before then.
Sincerely,
Howard Hilton
Technical Director

Dear Mr.Hilton,
First, I would like to apologize for the problem you encountered with your printer. This is the first defective product that we have ever been made aware of, and we have already contacted the Director of Production, Glen Milton, to investigate the current production practices for all Easy Jet 1435 printers. We certainly want to resolve this problem as quickly as possible. We are happy to pay for all repair costs, as well as all shipping fees. Please put the printer in its original box and send it to the Product Repair Department. The address for this department is provided in the Owner's Instruction Manual that came with the printer. We will have a specialist take a look at the machine immediately. You should have a working printer within three to four weeks. Please feel free to contact me at any time, should you have questions or comments.
Sincerely,
Margaret Willow
Director, Customer Relations, Easy Jet Office Supplies
