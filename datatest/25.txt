Dear Michael,
I am going shopping for the day. I have to buy a new table and chairs. I won't be home until eight o'clock this evening. Please take the dog for a walk and don't forget to clean your room. Your dinner is in the microwave. There is some orange juice in the refrigerator, too.
See you later!
Mom
