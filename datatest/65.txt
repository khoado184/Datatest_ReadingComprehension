Attn: All advertising associates
The meeting with Gilman Electronics was rescheduled from Friday, April 22, to Monday, May 25. I received an e-mail from their CEO, Robert Towney, informing me that Gilman Electronics is not ready to introduce the new computers due to production delays. Apparently, technicians discovered a serious defect in one of the microchips and consequently all of the computers have to be re-evaluated. Therefore, we have about a month to work on the advertising campaign. I recommend that we meet early next week - perhaps Monday or Wednesday - to discuss the current ad campaign and determine whether or not we want to change it now that we have some extra time. Please e-mail me by 4 p.m. today with your comments or suggestions about the Gilman account. As you know, Gilman is our biggest client so it is critical that we provide the best service possible.
Sinoerely,
Mark Johnson
Director of Advertising
