Candles are an important part of many cultural and religious festival and have been burnt in various forms for centuries. The ancient Romans and Egyptians made candles from a type of fiber coated with wax. However, up until the nineteenth century, most candles were made from a substance called tallow, obtained from beef fat. Tallow candles were very smoky and, understandably, had an unpleasant odor.

In the 19th century, candle makers learned to separate stearin, the solid form fat used as a type of glue, from tallow and used it to harden other fats. Candles that contained stearin would burn longer than previous ones and had a better smell. Stearin is still one of the main components of modern candle-making, and the techniques used to create candles today are much the same as they have been for many years. These days, the increase range of wax dyes, perfumes and other additives that are now available make candle making a very exciting and rewarding hobby.

Sales of candles have increased greatly over the last few years, showing that they have become part of our lives again, not through necessity, but because of the magical atmosphere they create. In our increasingly stressful lives, the calming quality of candlelight has a relaxing effect that many enjoy.
