That afternoon Molly almost danced along the street, as she walked home with her father from the station. They had seen Mrs. Gibson and Cynthia off to London. She wished her step-mother would take herself off to London much more often.
“Well now, dad,” she said, “I’m going to have you all to myself for a whole week. You must be very obedient.”
“I hope you aren’t going to boss me, Molly. You’re walking me out of breath already. We mustn’t pass Mrs. Goodmays in our hurry.”
They crossed the street to speak to Mrs. Goodmays, one of the doctor’s patients.
“We’ve just been seeing my wife and her daughter off to London. They’ve gone up for a week.”
“Dear me, to London, and only for a week!” said Mrs. Goodmays, with surprise. “It seems hardly worth the packing. It’ll be lonely for you, Molly, without your step-sister.”
“Yes,” said Molly, suddenly feeling as if she ought to have taken this view of the case. “I’ll miss Cynthia.”
“And you, Dr Gibson I hope you won’t feel like a widower once again. You must come and have supper with me one evening. What about Tuesday?”
Dr Gibson felt a sharp blow on his leg from the toe of Molly’s shoe, but even so he accepted the invitation, much to the old lady’s satisfaction.
A moment later Molly said to him, “How could you go and waste one of our precious evenings! We’ve only got five now. I’ve been planning all sorts of things for us to do together.”
“What sort of things?”
“Oh, I don’t know. Things you used to like.” She looked at him boldly. “Forbidden things now.”
Her father’s eyes lit up, but his face remained serious. “I’m not going to be pulled down, Molly. With hard work and sensible guidance I’ve reached a very fair height of civilised behaviour, and there I’m going to stay.”
“Oh no you’re not. We’re having bread and cheese for supper tonight, in armchairs in front of the TV! And you shall wear your dressing-gown at breakfast tomorrow-and every morning for a week! And you shall read the paper at the dining-table! That’s only a start. I haven’t finished by a long way yet.”
