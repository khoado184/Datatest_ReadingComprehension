JP Store is proud to announce its new catalogue service, which will begin this September. Each month all customers with a JP Gold Card will receive a free catalogue. What's so great about the JP Catalogue? You don't have to go to our store to buy your clothes. You can simply call the customer service hotline and place your order from the comfort of your own home. Plus, each month's catalogue will include special discounts on all our clothing. If you have any questions about this special promotion, contact us at 1-800-2365-9864. If you are not a cardholder and would like to become one, then download an application from our website, www.jpclothes.com. All customers who apply online before August 15th will receive an additional 20 percent off their first order.
