Waldorf Books is excited to announce it will be offering a new print-on-demand publishing service. The company has created a database of all the major and minor book titles in the world and developed a program that can access electronic versions of these books. If a customer is unable to find a book in paperback or hardcover in the store, he can go to the Print-On-Demand kiosk and with the push of a button print a copy of the book without ever leaving the store! This new technology has a couple of advantages: customers can choose from a more extensive selection of books, and the final product is cheaper. The service is especially useful for individuals who are most interested in less popular titles by relatively unknown authors. The print-on-demand service will be available at all Waldorf Books stores starting this September.
