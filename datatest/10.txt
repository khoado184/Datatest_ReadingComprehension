Love them or hate them, online shops are here to stay, and more and more are appearing on the world wide web every day. Shopping online should be quick, easy and, above all, safe, but many people still feel uncomfortable about doing business on the net. By following the advice below, you can ensure that your shopping trip in cyberspace is a successful one.
Before you purchase an item online, make sure that the website you are buying from is secure. Many websites use special technology to encrypt the credit card information that customers send over the Internet. If a site does not tell you that they are using this technology, you could also look for an icon of a locked padlock or an unbroken key at the bottom of your screen, an icon of a lock on your status bar.
Many websites ask you to choose a password for future orders. Make sure you use a different password to the one you use to log on to your computer or network. Never use your address, date of birth, phone number or other recognizable words as your password. Instead, pick at least five letters, numbers and punctuation marks. One idea is to use the first letter of each word in a song title and throw in some numbers and punctuation marks. For example, "vyslmt813" comes from "Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow". Don't write your password down, as somebody might see it and be able to use it. If you can't remember your password and have to write it down, try reversing the order of the characters, or change the order of the letters and numbers so that anyone who finds it still won't know your true password.
Never e-mail anyone your password and credit card details. Only give them in a secure connection on a website. You should make sure that you are not making your personal information accessible to thieves as this will allow them to impersonate you. "Theft of identity" which involves someone accessing your bank account, getting credits or loans in your name, or using your credit card details to purchase products, is a growing problem these days. If you don't like the idea of giving your credit card details over the Internet, most online stores allow you to order online and pay over the phone. However, you should be sure to make a note of the company's phone number, the date and time of your call and the name of the person you spoke to.
These tips should ensure that you will have a safe and easy shopping experience. However, as in all areas of life, it is important to have faith in your instincts. If you don't feel comfortable buying an item over the Internet, or if you do not trust a website one hundred percent, then you may well be right. Happy shopping!
