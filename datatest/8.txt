British doctors are demanding that smoking be banned in public places in Britain, following the example set by Ireland and many US cities. They argue that most public places are “somebody's workplace” and that employers have the duty to protect employees from harm.
The British Medical Association strongly believes that a public ban on smoking will dramatically reduce levels of heart dis-ease, lung cancer, bronchitis, pneumonia and asthma, which are all related to passive smoking. Passive smoking kills an estimated 1000 adults in Britain every year and also causes various illnesses in children, including asthma, lung infections and ear diseases. The presidents of Britain's Royal Colleges of Medicine believe that it is time to make public places smoke free and claim that most members of the public find cigarette smoke unpleasant and annoying. They believe that most smokers and non-smokers would rather see smoking banned from public places.
British Public Health Minister, Melanie Johnson, rejects the idea of a public ban by arguing that since progress is being made on a voluntary basis, a universal ban could not be justified. Especially not before receiving the universal approval of the public. She also states that many problems will surface if we have to implement a ban with enforcement. She believes that a lot more could be done to reduce smoking via education and public persuasion.
Professor Carol Black, president of the Royal College of Physicians, predicts that a public ban will encourage 300,000 people to quit smoking and will save 150,000 lives in the long term. Professor Black also stressed that the current self-regulation system is not producing results, and that progress is moving slowly in the hospitality industry; especially in clubs, pubs, and restaurants.
The government, however, still has no intention of setting specific deadlines by which the hospitality industry must comply.
The government prefers using less severe techniques to decrease the number of smokers. The latest being an additional 138 million pound grant to help smokers quit over the next three years, the introduction of warning labels on cigarette packs, and the banning of tobacco advertising.
The British government's main concern is not to alienate the public, half of whom still want pubs to allow smoking, according to a poll conducted for the Department of Health.
Singapore, Thailand, and parts of Australia have already installed the bans and Norway and the Irish Republic will soon follow suit in 2004.
