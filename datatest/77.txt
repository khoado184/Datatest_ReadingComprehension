November 9
Dear Ms. LeChevre,
We would like to invite you to participate in our upcoming meeting, to be held on Wednesday, November 17 at 6:00 p.m. at the Hilton Suites. During this meeting we plan to hold an election for the next LBA president, who will serve for the coming year. Past presidents will be present to explain the importance of the position and to help facilitate the voting process. This year we have four members interested in running for this position; please note that their professional profiles are attached. Make sure to review these profiles prior to the meeting. There will be a question-and-answer session with this year's candidates before voting begins. 
We are anticipating a large turnout at this year's election, and hope that you will be able to join us on this important day. If, for some reason, you are unable to attend, we ask that you send in your vote using the attached mail-in ballot. You can send the form to Local Businesses of Albany, 121 S. Main St., Albany, NY 12019. Please make sure that your ballot arrives by November 17.
Our bylaws state that a majority of the LBA's members must vote in the upcoming election in order for us to officially inaugurate a new president. Because of this, we ask that you make voting a priority and either attend the meeting or send in your ballot by mail.
Sincerely,
David Smith
