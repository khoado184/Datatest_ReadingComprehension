Attention All Employees
The executives at juniper Insurance have decided to purchase mobile phones for all employees. They are hoping that the new phone will improve communiation between members of different departments. The company will be purchasing forty-seven TM-161 cell phones from Globalphone Inc. at the end of july. You will receive your new phone during the first week of August. Each employee will be given 200 minutes free each month. If you use more than your monthly limit, you will be charged an additional $25 each month. We understand that this is a new policy that may potentially be problematic, so we welcome any comments or suggestions you may have. To monitor the new phone system's effectiveness, we will be asking employees to fill out a survey. The date for this survey has not been chosen yet. However, it will most likely take place during the third week of August. Also, employees with other suggestions about how to help employees communicate better should fill out an Employee Comments Form, which can be obtained from Betty Gill in the Human Resources Department.
