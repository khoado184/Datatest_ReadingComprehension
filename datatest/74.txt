Beginning this year, Renaissance Strategy Inc. will provide financial aid to fulltime employees with children in school. Financial aid is available to candidates from elementary school to college, but homeschooling is not included. There are also certain requirements that you must meet in order to be eligible for financial aid. Eligible candidates must be enrolled as full-time students and maintain passing grades. Candidates must also submit a copy of proof of enrollment along with application forms which you can find at the front of the administration division. How much aid your child receives will depend on your financial need and on the amount of other aid you receive. Aid will be paid directly to the school on a yearly basis. If you need more information or have any questions about the program, please call 123-5656.
