Dear Mr.Poll,
I was honored to receive an invitation to the commemoration dinner at the new conference center in Springfield, and I would be delighted to attend. I was in Milan on a business trip when the conference center was completed and I could not wait to get back and see how it looked. I agree with the general consensus that Limited Properties has created a place that is even better than the first conference center. In fact, I would like to host the 4th Annual Business Development Conference at the new facility in September. This year, representatives from Chile, Korea, China, Japan, and Australia will attend the event, and I am confident they would be impressed with the LP Grand Conference Center. Perhaps we could meet at the dinner and discuss this matter further. I look forward to seeing you there.
Sincerely,
Charles Gates
CEO, GMA Oil Corp.
