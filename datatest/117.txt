Sands looked up at the roof of the ruin, “This is the only part where we might try to sleep,” he said. “The beams up there support some stonework they’re the only ones that don’t look ready to come down on US.”
“Not for me, thanks, Professor,” Morris replied I’m too bony and sensitive to sleep on a stone floor. I’ll spread my blanket in the dust by the path.”
Professor Sands stared at him. “That wouldn’t do you any good at all. Besides it will be very cold up here after dark. Do you want your brain to soften?”
“My brain?” Now Morris pointed to the roof beams. “Mightn’t it be yours that risks damage should one of those suddenly decide to obey gravity in the middle of one of your pleasant dreams? What exactly do you mean?”
“It’s unhealthy, even foolish, to sleep without a roof of some sort over your head. Being high, as we are on this mountain, is a great help, but it’ s not enough.”
“Tonight will be all right, surely. It’s a lovely evening, and the sky is clear. I’ve got warm clothes. I’m not worried about a change in the weather”
“Nor am I. It’s the weight I’m thinking of. The brain needs protection from it. Many creatures have developed their own – a shell for example. Fish always have the sea above them. Foxes spend most of their time underground. To sleep undefended, uncovered to the air, like the most stupid animals, is simply asking for trouble. Do you wish to take after a goat or a sheep? Sleep under this roof, Morris, where the weight can’t reach you.”
“What weight do you mean?” Morris cried, losing patience.
The professor sighed. He had to explain even the simplest details to some of his students. “The air, of course,” he said. “It’s a great blanket of gas, eighty kilometres thick, and it’s pressing, pressing, pressing down on US. It’s the brain that suffers most. We must do all we can to shield it. Do you know the terrific weight on your head when you stand out there?”
Morris closed his eyes. “I don’t notice it. I’ve grown used to it.” He laughed.
“That won’t help you. You must try to avoid it as I do. The roof here will protect; and I use this too.” He opened his bag and took out a small metal helmet “Have you a hat or something to cover your head?”
