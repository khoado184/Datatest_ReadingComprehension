Dear Susie,
How are you ? I'm doing fine here at summer camp. We go swimming every day. At first, I was scared of the water. But now, after swimming lessons, I enjoy it. At night, we have a campfire. It's so pretty to look at. We usually sing songs and watch the stars until we fall a sleep. I really enjoy that part of the day. I have met lots of really nice people, but I still miss home and all my friends.
See you in two weeks!
Your friend,
Jessica
