The Smallville Department of Transportation (SDT) announced that it will begin construction on a new bus lane downtown. The construction is scheduled to begin at the end of July, a city official said. The new bus lane will provide direct service to the main financial district, and will replace bus lines 3 and 4. Studies have been conducted on traffic patterns and it is expected that the new service will reduce commuting time by 25 percent. Crane Construction has been contracted to build the new lane. Unfortunately, Main St. will be closed from July 22nd to August 30th, while the construction is taking place. The SDT has asked all commuters who drive to work to take 122 Avenue instead of Main Street.
