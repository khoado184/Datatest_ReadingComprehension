Afred Wainwright told me that one day in November 1952 he decided to set himself a new task. He would climb all the hills and mountains in the English Lake District and keep a notebook and drawings of all the routes, just for his own enjoyment. He was by then forty-five, with a full-time job, and he calculated that doing the 200 or so climbs in his spare time would take him thirteen years, nearly up to his sixtieth birthday.

It was the publication of the new maps on the 1 to 25,000 scale which set off the idea. He’d always felt disappointed by the 1 to 50,000 maps because of the lack of detail. On a 1 to 50,000 map a walker can be walking about all day in an area represented by 10 square centimetres. With the larger-scale maps, he has the impression of covering more ground more quickly. He can move from the top of the map to the bottom in a day. He wanted to check out the new, bigger-scale maps and fill in for himself details like fields and walls.

‘I love maps. Maps have always been my favourite literature. I would always rather study a map than read a book, even a map of a place I have never been to and never will. Have you ever tried to draw a map? There’s nothing like it for real interest and concentration. I like to follow streams up from the valley to their source, and if I cannot do it on the ground.I like to do it on maps. I like to stand on a mountain top and see the valley below as on a map.”

“Sometimes I think I should have taken up map-making as a career, instead of which I turned out to be an accountant, sitting in an office all day, with figures that passed in and out of the mind. The figures that stay there permanently are the heights of mountains – Scafell Pike 3,206, Bowfell 2,960, Pillar 2,927.”
