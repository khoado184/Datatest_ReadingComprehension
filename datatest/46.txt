Subject: Company Picnic
Hello, I just wanted to let everyone know that the Tollins company picnic has heen cancelled because there is a chance of rain on the day we originally chose. As you know, we wanted to have the picnic outdoors so that employees could participate in a variety of team-building exercises.
We asked the Humble Country Club if we could hold the lunch in their Club House instead, but unfortunately they told us that Plymouth Autos will be holding a special banquet to celebrate their 25th anniversary there.
Attached to this email is an Employee Preference Form. I am asking all employees to list their preferred date for the rescheduled company picnic. I sincerely hope that we can accommodate everyone’s schedule. Please fill out the form and email it to me by Thursday, March 21st, at 3 p.m.
Regards.
