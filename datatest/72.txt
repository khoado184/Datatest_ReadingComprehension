Subject: Salary lnquiry
I received your email about your request for an increase in your salary, which you submitted to the Human Resources Department on February 22. We certainly appreciate the demands that this position places on you, and understand that other companies pay more for the same amount of work.
As you know, however, Dataware is a small domestic company that just began operating in New York a year ago. Therefore, we do not have a large enough budget to comply with your request. As we discussed in our initial interview, there is a possibility that you will receive a promotion and a ten percent salary increase at the end of this year. Unfortunately, we can not offer you anything at this point. In fact, I was quite surprised that you were requesting a salary increase less than 2 months after the date you signed the contract.
I understand that you are currently looking for other work. If you do not find this response acceptable, then I regretfully accept your resignation.
Sinoerely,
Patty Gore

Dear Mr. Humphrey,
I am writing to confirm my acceptance of your employment offer of March 15 and to inform you how excited I am to be joining Data Processors in London. Software engineering is exactly what I went to school for and I feel confident that I will make a significant contribution to the corporation. I am thankful for the opportunity you have given me.
As we talked about on the phone, I will report to work at 9:00 a.m. on Marrh 22 and will have completed the medical examination and drug testing by the start date. Also, I will complete all the employment and insurance forms for the new employee orientation on March 24.
I look forward to meeting everyone and am grateful for your generous offer.
Sincerely,
Meghan Michaels
