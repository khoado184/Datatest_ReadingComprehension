Subject: Details for Conference on December 2
Hi, Chris!
First, I'd like to express my excitement that you've agreed to speak at this year's technology conference. As you know, Runt Corporation has been organizing this event for the last ten years to promote innovation in the computer industry.
In my previous email, I told you that the conference would start at 8 a.m., but it has been changed to 9 a.m. because a few of the companies who will be providing exhibits wanted a little more time to set up their product displays. Now, when you get to the conference center, you will have to pass through security. Please hand the security guard the four-digit code that I gave you, and he will issue you a temporary visitor's ID badge. You will need to wear this badge at all times while you are in the building.
lf you need us to provide any equipment, such as a laptop computer, or overhead projector, please contact the event organizer, Martin Walsh. His email address is mwalsh@runtcorp.com. You can also reach him by phone at 1-520-236-1478.
Please feel free to contact me with any further questions that you might have. I look forward to meeting you on the day of the conference.
Beth Volt, Public Relations Director

Subject: Update on December 2 Conference
Dear Mrs. Volt,
Thank you so much for your kind email. I am also very excited to speak at your conference. My company's innovative business strategy has greatly increased our profit margins and I am confident that, if implemented properly, it will help any computer company improve its total computer sales.
Since the subject I plan to cover is rather technical, I have asked one of my colleagues, Bill Front, to give a brief PowerPoint presentation to familiarize the audience with a few new technology terms. Mr.Front is a software designer who has been working for Spectron Inc. for five years. His innovative product designs have contributed greatly to Spectron's success in the last three years.
With regard to equipment, I will need a couple of things for the presentation. I will leave a list of required items with the event organizer when I visit his office on Wednesday, November 25. Thanks for all of your help.
Regards,
Chris Gately
