Dear Grandma,
Thank you for the new bike that you gave me for my birthday. I am so happy it is blue, as that is my favorite color. Mom and Dad gave me money and some new clothes, and I got an interesting CD from Uncle Joe. I like your present the most, though. I ride it every day. I promise that I will take good core of it.
Love,
John
