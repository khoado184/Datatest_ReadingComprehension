McDowell Publishing plans to merge with Harvey Nedia this January, a spokesman for McDowell Publishing said. The new company will be called McDowell and Harvey Media. The decision comes after both companies experienced their third straight year of losses. Both companies have struggled to compete with the world‘s largest publishing company, Watson Nedia Inc., which accounts for about 75 percent of the market. Since Watson Media Inc. was founded by Charles Duvet JF. in 1999, the company has successfully forced ten other small publishing companies to declare bankruptcy. According to a spokesman from Harvey Media, after the merger is completed, the new company will launch a 3 million dollar marketing campaign. Jackson Polkins, the famous children's writer, has already announced he will be leaving Watson Media Inc. to pursue a contract with the new company
