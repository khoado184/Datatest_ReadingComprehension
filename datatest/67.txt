Subject: Photos
Dear Mr.Miller,
Your customer record stated that you preferred to be contacted by e-mail, so I am e-mailing you to say that your photographs will not be ready for Saturday at 3 p.m. as discussed. One of our processing machines broke down yesterday. The repairman said the new part has to be specially ordered, and probably won't arrive for another four to five days. This means that the Belltown branch of Ace Photos only has one machine to process nearly 150 different orders. I noticed that you marked your order as "URGENT" on the processing request form; however, due to the circumstances our 24 hour service is no longer available. Your photos will probably be ready by Tuesday morning at the earliest. If you would rather have your photos processed at another Ace Photos location, we would be happy to mail them for you. We will cover all the delivery charges, and have the photos mailed directly to you when they are finished. Also, we would like to offer you $15 off the total order cost to compensate for any inconvenience this problem may have caused. Please call me at 1-800-652-3156 to discuss this matter further.
Sincerely,
Linda Tillman
Director Customer Relations
