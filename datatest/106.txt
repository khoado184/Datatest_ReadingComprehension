ROBBIE’S FIRST BUSINESS
Robbie enjoyed art most at school. He liked maths and music too, but because it was hard for Robbie to spell words correctly or to understand texts, he didn’t enjoy being at school. In England, he had lots of problems. So, when Robbie was 12, his parents decided he should leave school and be taught differently at home. There, he learnt about business and working on computers, and spent more time happily studying art, exercising and practicing on his violin.
Robbie’s grandmother started teaching him to cook too, which, like his mother and aunt, he really enjoyed doing. One day, she told him her secret way of making jam. Robbie made too much for the family to eat so he took it to other people in his street. He made more and more jam. It tasted so good that his parents’ friends started buying it from him. Robbie added all his costs together then decided on a price. Then he made a business plan on the computer with help from his dad. His jam is now sold at a weekly market. It tastes wonderful and it’s healthy because Robbie uses grape juice instead of sugar to make it.
“I’m still only 14 but I’m already a businessman!” Robbie laughs. “Last week I earned £93 because 87 different customers bought 52 kilos of my jam, and a supermarket wants to sell it too. My career is in jam-making, I think!”
