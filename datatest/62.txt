Dear Mr.Johnson,
We received your request to change the dates of your reservation at the Glenwood Resort from April 15-22 to June 20-28. Unfortunately, I have checked the database and there are no rooms available for those dates. I sincerely apologize that we can not accommodate your request; unfortunately June, July, and August are our busiest months because we offer special summer discounts. I understand that your company is relocating you to London in July and therefore you can't make a reservation for any other date. I would like to mention, however, that Phillip D.Humboldt, the owner of Glenwood Resort, recently opened another luxury resort, Woodshire Retreat, just thirty minutes outside of Mulberry. If you would like to make a reservation at this resort, the number is 1-800-238-9648. Or you can make a reservation online at www.humboldthotels.com.
Sincerely,
Richard Kent
