The tanker lay in the bay for four days, a few hundred metres from the shore. In this tideless water she lay as still and secure as if fastened to a wall. In a way, she was, for the sandy bottom held her in its grip. Twice the harbour master’s boat went out to her; the second time it brought off a number of the crew. It never occurred to the watchers on shore that the ship was in danger, she looked so calm and seaworthy. From time to time there was activity on board: when a land wind rose in the evenings, the tanker’s engines came to life. Then the vessel shook herself and strained fiercely, but none of it did her any good. She just stayed where she was in the bay.
The July sun blazed down on her flat decks. Occasionally a seaman, stripped to the waist, came out on to the deck with the movements of someone performing a complicated dance, stepping lightly, never resting on that burning metal. Once or twice he kept close to the ship’s rail, with an arm raised against the sunlight, staring at the people on the beach. Throughout the day the air rose in visible waves from the tanker’s decks. When a sea wind blew, it brought with it the heavy smell of oil. At night the ship lay in total darkness.
On the fifth morning a thick bank of sea mist filled the bay. It seemed that the tanker had got away in the night and gone into harbour. But this was an illusion. Slowly, as the fog cleared a little, she came into view again but farther out. Soon two figures could be seen at work on her decks. There was the sound of hammering, of metal on metal, and then of something heavy falling on to the deck. At once the watchers on shore were half blinded by a flash of yellow light that enveloped the ship from end to end. The explosion that followed the flash was like a single crack from a giant whip. In a moment the ship, except for a dark line at water level, was lost to sight behind the flames.
Two bodies were washed ashore in the bay. They were stripped to the waist, bare-footed, and black with flash bums. The right arm of one body was raised to the forehead as if shielding the eyes from some bright light. The other man wore a gold chain round his neck. The tanker burned for nine days and nights.
